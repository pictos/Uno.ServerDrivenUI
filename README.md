# Uno.ServerDriven.UI

This project, is a PoC, that allows users to update their app UIs without having to release a new version of the app. It is a simple implementation of the server-driven UI concept. The idea come from [Flutter Code Push](https://www.dhiwise.com/post/guide-to-flutter-code-push-streamlining-mobile-app#:~:text=Flutter%20Code%20Push%20is%20a,updates%20without%20all%20the%20hassle.) and the implementation was inspired by the [Maui.ServerDrivenUI](https://github.com/felipebaltazar/Maui.ServerDrivenUI/tree/main).
